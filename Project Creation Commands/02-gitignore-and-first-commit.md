# Git Configuration and First Commit

## .gitignore File Content

**Add this content to your `.gitignore` file:**

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/
*/node_modules/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*/dist/
*/build/

# Docker
.dockerignore

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# Database
*.db
*.sqlite

# Kubernetes secrets
*secret*.yaml
```

**Why each section matters:**
- **Dependencies**: `node_modules/` can be huge (100K+ files), should be regenerated
- **Environment variables**: Contains sensitive API keys, database passwords
- **Build outputs**: Generated files that shouldn't be committed
- **IDE files**: Personal editor settings, not needed by other developers
- **OS files**: System-generated files that clutter the repository
- **Logs**: Runtime files that change constantly
- **Database**: Local database files with potentially sensitive data
- **Kubernetes secrets**: Security-sensitive configuration files

## First Commit Commands

```bash
# Stage all files for commit
git add .

# Create first commit with conventional commit message
git commit -m "feat: initial project structure with documentation"

# Check commit was created
git log --oneline
```

**What `git add .` does:**
- Stages all files in the project for commit
- Git will respect .gitignore and skip ignored files
- Prepares files to be included in the next commit

**What the commit message means:**
- `feat:` - Following conventional commits (indicates new feature)
- Describes what was added in this commit
