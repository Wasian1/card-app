# First Git Commit and Verification

## Step 1: Stage All Files
```bash
git add .
```

**What this does:**
- Stages all project files for commit
- Git respects .gitignore and skips ignored files
- Prepares files to be included in the next commit

**Files that will be staged:**
- `/docs/` folder (projectplan.md, documentation.md)
- `/Project Creation Commands/` folder with our command history
- All empty directories (backend/, frontend/, database/, etc.)
- `.gitignore` file with our ignore rules

**Files that will be ignored:**
- Any files matching patterns in .gitignore (none exist yet)

## Step 2: Create First Commit
```bash
git commit -m "feat: initial project structure with documentation"
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a snapshot of all staged files
- Uses conventional commit format (`feat:` for new feature)
- Records this as the first version in your project history

## Step 3: Verify Commit Was Created
```bash
git log --oneline
```

**What this shows:**
- One-line summary of all commits
- Should show your first commit with the message
- Displays the commit hash (unique identifier)

**Expected output:**
```
a1b2c3d feat: initial project structure with documentation
```

## Step 4: Check Repository Status
```bash
git status
```

**What this shows:**
- Current state of your working directory
- Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
- Confirms all changes are committed
