# K-Pop Gacha Card Game - API Architecture & Game Design

**Date**: Current Session  
**Phase**: 2.3 Database APIs and Game Mechanics Design  
**Achievement**: First database-backed API with complete game architecture planning

## üéÆ Complete Gacha Card Game Flow & Route Architecture

### Game Overview
A gacha-style card collection game where users collect digital cards of K-pop idols through a timed pull system, manage their collections, and track completion progress across different groups and rarity levels.

### Core Game Mechanics
- **44 Unique Cards**: 22 artists √ó 2 versions each (different photos/poses)
- **5-Tier Rarity System**: 1‚≠ê to 5‚≠ê cards with different pull rates
- **Cooldown System**: 12-hour cooldown between pulls, max 5 stored pulls
- **Collection Tracking**: Progress by group, rarity, and overall completion
- **Duplicate Management**: Track duplicates for future trading system

## üöÄ Complete API Route Architecture

## üÉè Card Rarity & Pull Rate System

### Rarity Distribution (Matches Real Gacha Games)
```
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5-Star Legendary): Main idols (RM, Lisa, Nayeon) 
- Pull Rate: 2% 
- Count: 6 cards total
- Examples: RM v1, Lisa v2, Nayeon v1

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4-Star Epic): Popular/Lead members
- Pull Rate: 8% 
- Count: 16 cards total
- Examples: Jungkook, Jennie, Sana

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3-Star Rare): Regular group members  
- Pull Rate: 25%
- Count: 15 cards total

‚≠ê‚≠ê (2-Star Common): Supporting members
- Pull Rate: 35%
- Count: 7 cards total

‚≠ê (1-Star Basic): Entry-level cards
- Pull Rate: 30% 
- Count: 0 cards (none in current set)
```

### Database Query for Pull System
```sql
-- Weighted random card selection for gacha pulls
WITH rarity_weights AS (
  SELECT 
    card_id,
    rarity_level,
    CASE 
      WHEN rarity_level = 5 THEN 2    -- 2% chance
      WHEN rarity_level = 4 THEN 8    -- 8% chance  
      WHEN rarity_level = 3 THEN 25   -- 25% chance
      WHEN rarity_level = 2 THEN 35   -- 35% chance
      WHEN rarity_level = 1 THEN 30   -- 30% chance
    END as weight
  FROM cards
)
SELECT card_id, artist_id, version, rarity_level
FROM rarity_weights
ORDER BY RANDOM() * weight DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- Async/await pattern mastery for database operations
- Professional error handling and modular route architecture

### üîÑ Next Steps (Phase 2.4)
- GET /api/artists/:id - Individual artist details
- GET /api/cards - All available cards with rarity info
- GET /api/cards/:id - Individual card details
- Basic collection viewing endpoints

### ‚è≥ Future Phases (2.5-2.6)
- User authentication system with JWT
- Gacha pull engine with weighted randomization
- Collection management and progress tracking
- Cooldown system with automated refresh cronjobs

## üìä Database Schema Alignment

### Existing Tables Support Game Mechanics
```sql
-- artists (22 records) ‚Üí Idol information
-- cards (44 records) ‚Üí 2 versions per artist with rarity
-- users ‚Üí Player accounts
-- user_cards ‚Üí Collection ownership tracking  
-- user_pulls ‚Üí Gacha cooldown and pull tracking
```

### Additional Tables for Full Game (Future)
```sql
-- achievements ‚Üí Milestone tracking
-- trades ‚Üí Card trading system
-- user_achievements ‚Üí Achievement progress
-- pull_history ‚Üí Detailed pull analytics
```

## üéØ Success Metrics & Engagement

### Collection Completion Hooks
- **Group Completion Bonuses**: Complete BTS set ‚Üí unlock special achievement
- **Rarity Challenges**: Collect all 5‚≠ê cards ‚Üí exclusive title
- **Duplicate Value**: Trade duplicates for guaranteed pulls
- **Seasonal Events**: Limited-time cards with higher pull rates

### Social & Competition Features  
- **Leaderboards**: Global and group-specific rankings
- **Collection Sharing**: Show off rare card collections
- **Trade System**: Exchange duplicates with other players
- **Achievement Badges**: Display collection milestones

This architecture creates a genuinely engaging card collection game while serving as an excellent learning project for full-stack development, database optimization, and game mechanics implementation.

## Status
‚úÖ **Game Architecture Designed**: Complete route structure and mechanics planned  
‚úÖ **First API Endpoint**: GET /api/artists returning real database data  
‚úÖ **Foundation Ready**: Database, authentication, and scalable route organization  
‚è≥ **NEXT**: Individual artist lookup API for card preview functionality
